### Setting priorities 

greater would cause the smallest element to appear as the top().  <br>
less would cause the largest element to appear as the top().  <br>
Beside greater and less, we can create our custom comparator with function or custom class or struct. <br>
	declare a class "same as named in 3rd parameter" and overload operator() for it
